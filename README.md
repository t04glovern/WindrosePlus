## Features

### Live Sea Chart
A real-time map of your server showing player positions, creature locations, and island terrain, right in your browser. The map generates automatically when the first player connects.

![Sea Chart](docs/screenshots/seachart.png)

### Admin Console (RCON)
Run commands from a web dashboard with autocomplete. Check who's online, view server stats, repair known character-save drift, monitor performance, and manage your server remotely. 30 built-in commands out of the box.

![Console](docs/screenshots/console.png)

### Server Query
Windrose dedicated servers don't respond to standard server queries, so your server won't show player counts or status to external tools. Windrose+ adds a query responder so server browsers and monitoring tools can see your server.

```json
{
  "server": {
    "name": "My Windrose Server",
    "version": "0.10.0.1.6",
    "windrose_plus": "1.0.14",
    "password_protected": false,
    "max_players": 10,
    "player_count": 3
  },
  "players": [
    { "name": "HumanGenome", "alive": true, "x": 14520, "y": -8340 },
    { "name": "CaptainMorgan", "alive": true, "x": 6200, "y": 1100 }
  ],
  "multipliers": {
    "xp": 3.0, "loot": 2.0, "stack_size": 5.0,
    "craft_efficiency": 2.0, "cooking_speed": 2.0, "harvest_yield": 2.0
  }
}
```

### 2,400+ Server Settings & Multipliers
Adjust XP, loot, crafting costs, cooking/smelting speed, harvest yield, and more through a simple JSON file. Go deeper with 2,400+ individual INI settings for player stats, weapons, food effects, creature stats, co-op scaling, swimming, and rest bonuses.

> **Disabled multiplier keys:** `points_per_level`, `stack_size`, `weight`, `inventory_size`, and `crop_speed` are parsed for backward compatibility but do not write server PAK changes. They were disabled after live crash evidence from Windrose's character, inventory, and crop validators. `wp.givestats` only records an audit note; it does not change a character in-game.

> **Save-safety warning:** `inventory_size`, `stack_size`, `weight`, and other inventory-affecting PAK edits can become part of player save state once a character logs in and saves. Take an out-of-band save backup before enabling them. Windrose+ now refuses to build these high-risk multiplier PAKs when another installed PAK also edits inventory assets, and removes the existing generated multiplier PAK on that failure, unless an advanced admin deliberately sets `WINDROSEPLUS_ALLOW_PAK_CONFLICTS=1`.

**Multipliers** (`windrose_plus.json`):
```json
{
  "xp": 3.0,
  "loot": 2.0,
  "stack_size": 5.0,
  "craft_efficiency": 2.0,
  "cooking_speed": 2.0,
  "harvest_yield": 2.0,
  "inventory_size": 2.0,
  "weight": 1.0
}
```

**Player Stats** (`windrose_plus.ini`):
```ini
[PlayerStats]
MaxHealth = 320
MaxStamina = 150
StaminaRegRate = 40
MaxPosture = 40
Armor = 0
MaxWeight = 99999
```

**Food Effects** (`windrose_plus.food.ini`):
```ini
[Food_Drink]
Food_Drink_Coffee_T03_Duration = 1800
Food_Drink_Coffee_T03_Endurance = 20
Food_Drink_Coffee_T03_MaxHealth = 160
Food_Drink_Coffee_T03_Mobility = 20

[Alchemy_Potions]
Alchemy_Potion_Healing_Base_HealthRestoreRatio = 0.35
Alchemy_Potion_Healing_Great_HealthRestoreRatio = 0.8
```

### Mod Support
Drop a Lua script into the `Mods/` folder and it loads automatically. Add custom commands, scheduled tasks, and player join/leave hooks. Changes hot-reload without restarting the server.

**For modders** — full API reference, manifest format, and examples are in [docs/scripting-guide.md](docs/scripting-guide.md). Admin command list: [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md). Config keys: [docs/config-reference.md](docs/config-reference.md).

Ships with an example mod:

```lua
-- example-welcome/init.lua
local API = WindrosePlus.API

API.onPlayerJoin(function(player)
    API.log("info", "Welcome", player.name .. " joined the server")
end)

API.onPlayerLeave(function(player)
    API.log("info", "Welcome", player.name .. " left the server")
end)

API.registerCommand("wp.greet", function(args)
    local players = API.getPlayers()
    local names = {}
    for _, p in ipairs(players) do table.insert(names, p.name) end
    return "Ahoy, " .. table.concat(names, ", ") .. "!"
end, "Greet all online players")
```

### Server Activity Log
Windrose+ records server-side activity to `windrose_plus_data\logs\YYYY-MM-DD.log` for review and external tooling. Files are line-delimited JSON, append-only, and rolled daily — they survive server restarts and crashes.

Recorded events:

| `ev`                | Fires on                                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `mod.boot`          | Windrose+ initializes (version, game dir, hook avail.) |
| `config.load`       | `windrose_plus.json` is loaded or reloaded             |
| `config.load.fail`  | Config parse fails — defaults are used                 |
| `player.join`       | A player connects                                      |
| `player.leave`      | A player disconnects                                   |
| `admin.command`     | Any `wp.*` command runs (caller, args, result, ms)     |
| `heartbeat`         | Every 5 minutes — uptime, mode, player count, config   |

Each line carries a fixed envelope: `ts` (UTC ISO-8601), `ts_unix`, `sid` (per-boot session id), `ev`, and `payload`. External tools (and mods, via `WindrosePlus.API.logEvent(ev, payload)`) can tail the current day's file or read past days for replay.

Quick queries with `jq`:

```bash
# What multipliers were active during the corruption window?
jq 'select(.ev=="heartbeat") | {ts, mult: .payload.multipliers}' logs/2026-04-27.log

# Who ran which admin commands?
jq 'select(.ev=="admin.command") | {ts, admin_user, command, status}' logs/2026-04-27.log
```

### Character Repair
The dashboard includes a Character Repair page at `/repair` for the known progression drift crash where the server log shows `RewardLevel < CurrentLevel` during `R5BLPlayer_ValidateData`.

The repair page works on a client save zip, not the server world save:

1. Close Windrose completely.
2. Zip `%LOCALAPPDATA%\R5\Saved\SaveProfiles\<your-steamid-folder>`.
3. Open the Windrose+ dashboard, go to **Repair**, and upload the zip.
4. Download `windrose-save-repaired.zip`.
5. Extract it back into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\R5\Saved\SaveProfiles\` and replace the old files.

Safe mode only fixes no-spend progression drift. If the save has spent-point drift or a different corruption type, Windrose+ refuses the repair instead of guessing.

## Installation

You need a Windrose Dedicated Server already set up on Windows. If you don't have one yet, you can [rent a server from SurvivalServers](https://www.survivalservers.com/services/game_servers/windrose/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=windrose_plus) (Windrose+ comes pre-installed) or [set one up yourself](https://www.survivalservers.com/wiki/index.php?title=How_to_Create_a_Windrose_Server_Guide).

### Step 1: Download and Install

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/releases/latest).
2. Extract the zip into your Windrose Dedicated Server folder (e.g. `C:\WindroseServer\`).
3. Open PowerShell in that folder and run:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

This downloads UE4SS, installs the mod, and sets up the dashboard. Reinstalling is safe, your custom configs and mods are preserved.

### Step 2: Start Your Server

Edits to `multipliers` in `windrose_plus.json` or to any `.ini` file need to be baked into a game override PAK before the server launches — otherwise the game loads the unmodified defaults. That rebuild step is what `tools/WindrosePlus-BuildPak.ps1` does.

**The easy way:** run `StartWindrosePlusServer.bat` (installed at your server root). It runs the rebuild step if anything changed (no-op in milliseconds otherwise), then launches `WindroseServer.exe`.

**If you already have your own launcher**, add one line before whatever calls `WindroseServer.exe`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<gameDir>\windrose_plus\tools\WindrosePlus-BuildPak.ps1" -ServerDir "<gameDir>" -RemoveStalePak
```

Non-zero exit means the build failed — don't launch the game.

Windrose+ loads automatically either way.

> **Note:** You must **Run as Administrator** when starting the server. Windrose+ uses a proxy DLL (UE4SS) that requires elevated permissions to load.

To start the web dashboard, open a second terminal in your game server folder and run:

```powershell
windrose_plus\start_dashboard.bat
```

The dashboard URL and RCON password are shown in the console. On first run, a `windrose_plus.json` config file is created with defaults.

By default the dashboard listens on all interfaces when PowerShell is elevated, then falls back to localhost if Windows blocks the wildcard listener. Multi-IP hosts can bind it to one address:

```powershell
windrose_plus\start_dashboard.bat -BindIp 192.0.2.10
```

You can also set `"server": { "bind_ip": "192.0.2.10" }` in `windrose_plus.json`.

---

## Using Windrose+

### Configuring Your Server

Windrose+ has two config files:

- **`windrose_plus.json`** (basic): multipliers, RCON password, admin Steam IDs, feature flags. Created automatically on first launch. Edit this for everyday changes.
- **`windrose_plus.ini`** (advanced): player base stats, weapon damage, food effects, creature stats, talents, combat tuning. Optional — copy `windrose_plus\config\windrose_plus.default.ini` to `windrose_plus.ini` if you want to customize.

Example `windrose_plus.json`:

```json
{
    "multipliers": {
        "loot": 2.0,
        "xp": 3.0,
        "stack_size": 5.0
    },
    "rcon": {
        "enabled": true,
        "password": "your-password-here"
    },
    "server": {
        "http_port": 8780,
        "bind_ip": ""
    }
}
```

Multiplier and `.ini` edits need the override PAK rebuilt before the next launch — see [Step 2](#step-2-start-your-server) for the rebuild command (`StartWindrosePlusServer.bat` handles it for you). RCON password, admin IDs, and feature flags are read live and take effect without a rebuild.

See [docs/config-reference.md](docs/config-reference.md) for every advanced INI setting.

### Dashboard

Open the dashboard in your browser to manage your server. It includes a command console with autocomplete and a live Sea Chart showing player and mob positions in real-time.

### Commands

Type `wp.help` in the console to see all 30 available commands. Common ones:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `wp.status` | Server info and active multipliers |
| `wp.players` | Who's online and where |
| `wp.config` | Current settings |
| `wp.creatures` | What's spawned on the map |
| `wp.memory` | Server memory usage |

Full reference: [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md)

### Advanced: INI Settings

For fine-grained control beyond multipliers, Windrose+ supports 2,400+ individual settings across player stats, weapons, food, gear, and creatures.

Copy any `.default.ini` from the `config/` folder, rename it (drop `.default`), and edit only the values you want to change. Full reference: [docs/config-reference.md](docs/config-reference.md)

Type-specific files such as `windrose_plus.food.ini` and `windrose_plus.weapons.ini` can be used without creating a root `windrose_plus.ini`. `StartWindrosePlusServer.bat` includes those files in the rebuild hash, so edits trigger a new PAK build on the next launch.

### Mods

Windrose+ supports custom Lua mods. Drop a folder into `WindrosePlus/Mods/` with a `mod.json` and your script. It hot-reloads automatically.

See [docs/scripting-guide.md](docs/scripting-guide.md) for the API and examples.

<details>
<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

- **Server crashes on startup** - Check `UE4SS-settings.ini`. As of v1.1.4 only `HookProcessInternal` should be enabled; `HookEngineTick` must be `0` and `DefaultExecuteInGameThreadMethod` must be `ProcessEvent` on Windrose Shipping builds (older guidance to enable `HookEngineTick` is no longer correct).
- **RCON not working** - Set a real password in `windrose_plus.json` (not blank, not `changeme`).
- **Dashboard commands time out except `wp.help`** - Fully stop the game process and dashboard, then start them again. If you launched with `StartWindrosePlusServer.bat`, closing the console window can leave `WindroseServer-Win64-Shipping.exe` running in the background; stop it in Task Manager before relaunching.
- **No map data** - A player needs to connect at least once to trigger terrain export. If the Sea Chart still says "not ready", check `windrose_plus_data\map_generation_status.json`; it records whether tile generation is running, complete, or failed.
- **CurveTable PAK fails with a retoc error** - Run `windrose_plus\tools\WindrosePlus-BuildPak.ps1 -ForceExtract` once so the cache is rebuilt and the full retoc error is shown. If the message mentions `ScriptObjects`, make sure you are on v1.0.14 or newer; older builds passed only one `.utoc` file to retoc instead of the full `R5\Content\Paks` folder.
- **Fully disable Windrose+ for recovery testing** - Stop the server, rename `R5\Binaries\Win64\dwmapi.dll`, delete or move `R5\Content\Paks\WindrosePlus_Multipliers_P.pak` and `R5\Content\Paks\WindrosePlus_CurveTables_P.pak`, then delete `R5\Content\Paks\.windroseplus_build.hash`. Removing settings from `windrose_plus.json` is not enough because UE4SS and existing PAK overrides can still load.
- **Recovering from inventory/stack save issues** - Restore a save backup from before the inventory-affecting PAK change, fully disable Windrose+ as above, then confirm the character can join before re-enabling any PAK overrides.
