# Changelog

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Multipliers not applying to the game ([#2](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/2)).** Editing `windrose_plus.json` updated `wp.config` / `wp.status` but gameplay stayed at defaults because the override PAK the game loads at startup was never being rebuilt. Multiplier edits (and `.ini` edits) now need the rebuild step before launch — `StartWindrosePlusServer.bat` at the server root handles it automatically, or you can call `tools/WindrosePlus-BuildPak.ps1 -ServerDir "<gameDir>"` from your own launcher. Hash cache makes the no-change case a ~millisecond no-op.
- PAK builder now applies `inventory_size` and `points_per_level` multipliers in addition to the existing six. Both were parsed from config previously but never patched into the game files.

### Added

- `tools/bin/repak.exe` and `tools/bin/retoc.exe` are bundled in the release zip. No internet access or manual tool install required for the PAK rebuild step.
- Dashboard shows a "config changed — restart to apply" banner when it detects a stale PAK.
- `GET /api/pak-status` endpoint reports PAK freshness for tooling.
- Build-input hash cache (`R5\Content\Paks\.windroseplus_build.hash`) lets repeat launches of the wrapper exit in a fraction of a second when nothing has changed. Bumps to the bundled tools, the game pak, or the WindrosePlus version all invalidate it automatically.

### Changed

- Dashboard re-reads `windrose_plus.json` on every auth attempt instead of caching it at startup, so RCON password changes take effect without restarting the dashboard. Includes a short retry loop for transient read races.
- `[Multipliers]` in `windrose_plus.ini` now emits a warning and is ignored. Put multipliers in `windrose_plus.json` so the in-game `wp.config` stays honest about what's actually applied.
- `WindrosePlus-BuildPak.ps1` now fails loud with non-zero exit on any error and will not delete an existing override PAK unless invoked with the explicit `-RemoveStalePak` flag.
