# Changelog

## [1.0.7] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`MultiplierPakBuilder.ps1` crash on large `GrowthDuration` values ([#7](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/7)).** The crop-speed patcher cast the divided duration to `[int]` (Int32, max ~2.1 billion). Windrose stores some growth durations in game-time units that exceed that ceiling — the one reported hit 21 billion — so the cast threw `InvalidCastIConvertible` and aborted the build. Same fix applied to `Exp` (levels with huge XP requirements) and `CookingProcessDuration` so long production timers can't trip the same ceiling. All three now use `[long]` (Int64).
- **`wp.speed` refused to match players whose name contains a space ([#5](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/5)).** Handler assumed `args[1]` was the whole name and `args[2]` was the multiplier, so RCON whitespace-tokenizing "John Smith 1.5" into three args left `args[2] = "Smith"` which `tonumber` rejected. Now peels the multiplier off the trailing arg and joins everything before it as the name — same pattern already used by `wp.givestats`.
- **`wp.speed 1.0` did not visibly restore normal speed until server restart ([#5](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/5)).** `CheatMovementSpeedModifer` isn't replicated — setting it server-side updated server prediction but the client kept running at the old speed. Handler now caches each pawn's original `MaxWalkSpeed` on first touch and writes `MaxWalkSpeed = base * mult` alongside the cheat modifier, so `wp.speed <player> 1.0` takes effect immediately.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Stale version / invite code in `/status` after a Windrose game patch.** The query module loaded `R5\ServerDescription.json` once at server boot and cached the parsed values in memory, so when Windrose stamped a new `DeploymentId` into that file after a game update the HTTP endpoint kept reporting the old version until the dedicated server was restarted a second time. `_collectAndWrite` now re-reads the file every cycle, so `version`, `invite_code`, `name`, `password_protected`, and `max_players` reflect whatever is currently on disk within one status tick (5s active, 30s idle). The read is guarded by the existing `pcall(json.decode, …)`, so a mid-write race with the game leaves the previous cached values intact for that cycle.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **New `harvest_yield` multiplier.** Scales `Amount.Min`/`Amount.Max` on every entry inside `ResourcesSpawners/` JSON assets, so harvesting a resource node (berries, ore, wood, herbs, etc.) drops more (or fewer) items per interaction. Independent of `loot` (chest/enemy drops) and `crop_speed` (farm growth time). Range `0.1`–`100.0`, defaults to `1.0`. Surfaces in `wp.config`, `wp.status`, `server_status.json`, and the dashboard. Min stays at `1` after rounding so a low multiplier can't zero out a node.

### Notes

Issue [#4](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/4) (per-level stat rewards skipped when XP gain crosses multiple levels) remains open. The required engine-level catchup hook on `R5HeroLevelUpComponent` is still risky to register inside Windrose's UE4SS host (other RegisterHook attempts have crashed the server in earlier dev passes), so the fix stays deferred. `wp.givestats` (added in 1.0.4) is the manual compensation path; it still records to `windrose_plus_data/stat_grants_queue.log` for audit.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`wp.givestats <player> <stat_count> [talent_count]` admin command.** Records stat/talent point grant requests to a per-server queue file (`windrose_plus_data/stat_grants_queue.log`) so server owners can audit who needs compensation for [#4](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/4) — characters that level up multiple times in a single XP gain only fire one stat-point reward, even though they cleared several levels at once. Each invocation appends a timestamped JSON entry; the in-game application of those points lands in v1.0.5 alongside the level-up catchup hook (see notes below). Range `1`–`100` per axis. Player names with spaces are supported.
- **Append-only `windrose_plus_data/events.log`.** Line-delimited JSON records every player join and leave so external server-management tools can `tail -F` the file without polling the HTTP API or scraping the dashboard. Each entry has `ts`, `type`, `player`, and best-effort `x`/`y`/`z` (coordinates are populated only when the join/leave poller resolved a pawn position — they may be missing for very fast disconnects). Events derive from the same poll-based detector that powers the in-game player list, so a transient query miss can produce a spurious leave/rejoin pair; consumers should treat sub-second flips as noise. Existing in-process `WindrosePlus.API.onPlayerJoin` / `onPlayerLeave` callbacks are unchanged — this is an additive file-based channel for tools that don't run inside Lua.

### Notes for the next release

Issue [#4](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/4) (per-level stat rewards skipped when XP gain crosses multiple levels) is a base-game level-up event firing once per XP packet. The fix needs an in-game catchup hook on `R5HeroLevelUpComponent` to walk the levels gained and award the missed `StatPointsReward` / `TalentPointsReward` values one at a time. Until that lands, `wp.givestats` is the manual compensation path.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **`loot` multiplier was duplicating equipment drops ([#3](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/3)).** The PAK builder scaled every entry in every loot table, including weapons, armor, jewelry, and other one-of-a-kind gear. With `loot = 4`, a chest that should drop 1 sword dropped 4. The patcher now skips entries whose `LootItem` path lives under `InventoryItems/Equipments/` so only stackable resources scale.
- **`stack_size` multiplier was making explicitly-unstackable items stackable ([#3](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/3)).** The previous check (`MaxCountInSlot > 0`) treated `1` as "stack of one, scale it." Items the game intends to be unique — gear, jewelry, ship cannons, lore notes — were turning into stackable inventory. The check is now `> 1`, so original stack=1 items stay unstackable.

### Added

- **New `cooking_speed` multiplier.** Divides `CookingProcessDuration` on every Recipe in the PAK, which speeds up alchemy elixirs, fermentation, smelting, and any other timed production. Value is a multiplier just like `crop_speed` (`2.0` = half the time). Range `0.1`–`100.0`. Defaults to `1.0`. Surfaces in `wp.config`, `wp.status`, `server_status.json`, and the dashboard.

### Changed

- PAK builder now reads back temp-dir JSON via explicit BOM-less UTF-8 instead of `Get-Content -Raw`. Prevents Windows PowerShell 5.1 from mis-decoding files that an earlier multiplier already wrote, which would have caused `cooking_speed` and `points_per_level` to corrupt prior `craft_cost` / `xp` edits in mixed-shell setups.
- PAK builder clamps every multiplier input to a minimum of `0.01` defensively so passing `0` or a negative value can't divide-by-zero or collapse durations to garbage. Lua already clamps; this hardens the standalone `WindrosePlus-BuildPak.ps1` entry path.
- Dropped a dead `"Character"` filter in the `inventory_size` patcher. It scanned 877 files and matched zero — confirmed against the live game PAK. Net effect: faster builds, no behavior change.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **"Encoding errors" on Windows PowerShell 5.1** (the shell still shipped by default on Windows and on Nitrado hosts). Several bundled scripts and installer output contained em-dash characters in UTF-8 files without a byte-order-mark. Without a BOM, Windows PowerShell falls back to the legacy ANSI codepage and mangles those bytes into parse or display errors — the symptom some users worked around by manually swapping `powershell` for `pwsh` in their launchers. All bundled `.ps1` files now ship with a UTF-8 BOM so both `powershell` (5.1) and `pwsh` (7+) parse them correctly.
- **JSON output from the PAK builder had a BOM on 5.1 but not on 7.** `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` means "with BOM" on Windows PowerShell and "no BOM" on PowerShell 7 — a long-standing platform gotcha that made PAK contents subtly differ between shells. All JSON writes now emit BOM-less UTF-8 regardless of which shell runs them.

### Changed

- `StartWindrosePlusServer.bat` and `server/start_windrose_plus.bat` prefer PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) when it's on PATH and fall back to Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell`) otherwise. Both work correctly after the encoding fix above; the preference just picks the newer shell when available.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Multipliers not applying to the game ([#2](https://github.com/HumanGenome/WindrosePlus/issues/2)).** Editing `windrose_plus.json` updated `wp.config` / `wp.status` but gameplay stayed at defaults because the override PAK the game loads at startup was never being rebuilt. Multiplier edits (and `.ini` edits) now need the rebuild step before launch — `StartWindrosePlusServer.bat` at the server root handles it automatically, or you can call `tools/WindrosePlus-BuildPak.ps1 -ServerDir "<gameDir>"` from your own launcher. Hash cache makes the no-change case a ~millisecond no-op.
- PAK builder now applies `inventory_size` and `points_per_level` multipliers in addition to the existing six. Both were parsed from config previously but never patched into the game files.

### Added

- `tools/bin/repak.exe` and `tools/bin/retoc.exe` are bundled in the release zip. No internet access or manual tool install required for the PAK rebuild step.
- Dashboard shows a "config changed — restart to apply" banner when it detects a stale PAK.
- `GET /api/pak-status` endpoint reports PAK freshness for tooling.
- Build-input hash cache (`R5\Content\Paks\.windroseplus_build.hash`) lets repeat launches of the wrapper exit in a fraction of a second when nothing has changed. Bumps to the bundled tools, the game pak, or the WindrosePlus version all invalidate it automatically.

### Changed

- Dashboard re-reads `windrose_plus.json` on every auth attempt instead of caching it at startup, so RCON password changes take effect without restarting the dashboard. Includes a short retry loop for transient read races.
- `[Multipliers]` in `windrose_plus.ini` now emits a warning and is ignored. Put multipliers in `windrose_plus.json` so the in-game `wp.config` stays honest about what's actually applied.
- `WindrosePlus-BuildPak.ps1` now fails loud with non-zero exit on any error and will not delete an existing override PAK unless invoked with the explicit `-RemoveStalePak` flag.
