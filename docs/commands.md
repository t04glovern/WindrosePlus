## Map

### wp.mapgen

Generate a heightmap from landscape actors for the live map viewer. Must be run on a fresh server boot before any mod hot-reload (UE4SS cache issues prevent landscape detection after `RestartMod`).

```

```
> wp.mapgen
Heightmap exported: 4 landscapes, 16384 vertices
```

### wp.mapexport

Trigger the C++ HeightmapExporter mod to export raw terrain heightfield data. This writes binary `.bin` files to `windrose_plus_data/heightmaps/` which are then processed into map tiles by `windrose_plus/tools/generateTiles.ps1`.

```
Usage: wp.mapexport
```

```
> wp.mapexport
Heightmap export triggered — check windrose_plus_data/heightmaps/ for output
```
